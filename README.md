Gathering cool GIFs at the touch of a button

### Overview

This app is a great way to understand and use an API, dynamically generate content to the page and have click events that work on that new content.

### Libraries

I used Bootstrap for easy resonsive set up. jQuery was used for the AJAX calls and the DOM manipulation.
